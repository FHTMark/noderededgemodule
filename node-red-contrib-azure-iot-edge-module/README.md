# Azure IoT Edge Node-RED nodes

This package contains the Node-RED nodes that can be deployed to a Node-RED container running as an Azure IoT Edge module. These nodes enable you to interact with the IoT Edge platform using Node-RED. They will only work if the nodes are installed on a IoT Edge module running Node-RED. For more information on how to use the nodes, checkout the [Node-RED Edge Module Github repository](https://github.com/iotblackbelt/noderededgemodule). The nodes are also available as a precreated module for Azure IoT Edge.
